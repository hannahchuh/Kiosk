## Capital One Software Enginering Summit Coding Challenge Submission

This is my submission for the coding challenge for the Capital One Summit Software Engineering Summit of Summer '19. 
This app is live at <https://npsk-app.herokuapp.com/>

This app was built primarily using Python/Flask. This was my first time doing anything remotely web-dev related, so it's a new world to me! I chose to stick with using a Python web framework so as to complete the challenge within the deadline, as I have some experience from a project a couple years back using Python.

I had great fun getting to learn something on my own! I loved coding something that was a lot more free-form, with design choices up to the programmer, especially after the academic year. Thank you to Capital One for the opportunity to build this app and submit to the Software Engineering Summit!  

This app provides the following functionality (copied from the challenge spec).
1. Provides tools to assist users in finding specific information, such as state and designation filtering, name and keyword search.
2. Lists details about specific visitor centers, as well as nearby campgrounds.
3. Displays alerts, articles, events, and news releases about a selected destination.
4. Provides educational information about a selected destination, utilizing available lesson plans as well as relevant people and places associated with the location.

I have also included the bonus feature:

- When displaying information, utilize relevant symbols from the NPS Symbol Library to illustrate relevant items.
